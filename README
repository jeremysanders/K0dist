This is code to model the K0 distribution from Chandra observations of
a set of clusters from the SPT survey.

See "Hydrostatic Chandra X-ray analysis of SPT-selected galaxy
clusters - I. Evolution of profiles and core properties" by Sanders et
al.  (arXiv:1705.09299)

Requirements:
 python2, scipy, emcee and h5py

The code takes a set of posterior probability distributions taken from
a MCMC analysis of the individual systems. These are stored in the
HDF5 format file K0_dist_table_PosOnly.hdf5 (hdfview can be used to
examine this). The used datasets in the files are Kedges, which
defines the edges of the K0 bins the posterior distribtion was
calculated in.  Kbins gives the centres of the bins. likes gives the
probability density function in each K0-bin for each of the 82
clusters (the Bullet cluster is not included in this dataset). names
gives the names of the systems.

The model is a two skewed Gaussians in linear K0 space. Given a
particular model, we multiply the PDF by the K0 posterior probability
distribution for each cluster. These combined PDFs are integrated to
make a likelihood for each system, and combined to give a total
likelihood. The prior is added to make a final likelihood.

emcee is used to sample the likelihood function producing a chain in
K0_dist_chain_PosOnly.hdf5.

Finally median and 1-sigma percentile models are produced for the K0
PDF. These are written into K0_dist_meds_PosOnly.hdf5.
